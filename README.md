Mushroom Edible or Inedible Classification - 

One type of mushroom is edible while the other is poisonous among millions of mushroom species found globally. Identifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous can be challenging and requires expertise. Hence, it is crucial to classify mushrooms into these categories. Machine learning algorithms offer an alternative approach to classify mushrooms based on their physical or morphological features. The Mushroom dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository was used in this study. Models were built using eight different machine learning algorithms - Trivial System, Baseline System, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multi - Layer Perceptron, XgBoost - based on 15 features of the Mushroom dataset. By considering the physical appearance such as its shape, size of the mushrooms, we have experimented with all the models and shown the best accuracy and F - score.
